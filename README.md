# Algorithms


#SumOfTwoStringsEqualThird <br>
Basically the algorithm allow us to check if the third typed word can be made from the first and second typed words even if the word is mixed.<br>
For example:<br>
first word:"asd";<br>
second word:"qwe";<br>
third word : "sdaewq";<br>
it will return true.<br>
but if the third word is "sdaewt",<br>
then it will return false.<br>


#ReverseCalculator<br>

The idea behind this algorithm is searching for 2 numbers and if we will multiply them we will get our number we typed in.
For example if we want to know what for example what are 2 numbers we will multiply by each other will get us the number 77.
The answer is for example 7*11 or 77*1.
But if someone doesn't know how to multiply this algorithm solve this issue.
it uses for example euclid's algorithm
