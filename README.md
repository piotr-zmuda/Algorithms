# Algorithms


<h1>SumOfTwoStringsEqualThird</h1> <br>
Basically the algorithm allow us to check if the third typed word can be made from the first and second typed words even if the word is mixed.<br>
For example:<br>
first word:"asd";<br>
second word:"qwe";<br>
third word : "sdaewq";<br>
it will return true.<br>
but if the third word is "sdaewt",<br>
then it will return false.<br>


<h1>ReverseCalculator</h1><br>

The idea behind this algorithm is searching for 2 numbers and if we will multiply them they will equal searched number.<br>
For example if we want to know what are 2 numbers that equal 77 by multiplying them.<br>
The answer is 7*11 or 77*1.<br>
But if someone doesn't know how to multiply this algorithm solve this issue.<br>
it uses for example euclid's algorithm<br>
