#SumOfTwoStringsEqualThird <br>
Basically the algorithm allow us to check if the third typed word can be made from the first and second typed words even if the word is mixed.<br>
For example:<br>
first word:"asd";<br>
second word:"qwe";<br>
third word : "sdaewq";<br>
it will return true.<br>
but if the third word is "sdaewt",<br>
then it will return false.<br>
