#SumOfTwoStringsEqualThird <br>
Basically the algorithm allow us to check if the third typed word can be made from the first and second typed words even if the word is mixed.
For example:
first word:"asd";
second word:"qwe";
third word : "sdaewq";
it will return true.
but if the third word is "sdaewt",
then it will return false.
